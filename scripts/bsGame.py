class Actor(object):
    """
    category: Game Flow Classes

    Actors are high level organizational entities that generally manage one or
    more bs.Nodes, bits of game media, etc, along with the associated logic to
    wrangle them.

    If bs.Nodes represent cells, think of bs.Actors as organs.
    Some example actors include bs.Bomb, bs.Flag, and bs.Spaz.

    One key feature of actors is that they generally 'die'
    (killing off or transitioning out their nodes) when the last python
    reference to them disappears, so you can use logic such as:

    # create a flag in our activity
    self.flag = bs.Flag(position=(0,10,0))

    # later, destroy the flag..
    # (provided nothing else is holding a reference to it)
    self.flag = None

    This is in contrast to the behavior of the more low level bs.Nodes,
    which are always explicitly created and destroyed regardless of how many
    python references to them exist.

    Another key feature of bs.Actor is its handleMessage() method, which
    takes a single arbitrary object as an argument. This provides a safe way
    to communicate between bs.Actor, bs.Activity, bs.Session, and any other
    object providing a handleMessage() method.  The most universally handled
    message type for actors is the bs.DieMessage.

    # another way to kill the flag from the example above:
    # we can safely call this on any bombsquad type with a 'handleMessage'
    # method. (though its not guaranteed to always have a meaningful effect)
